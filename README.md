Risk and Hazard Assessment of Indian Sub-Districts: A Comprehensive Framework

This document outlines a comprehensive framework for assessing risks and hazards faced by Indian sub-districts. The assessment goes beyond essential hazard presence to consider various threats' likelihood and potential impact.

**Multi-Faceted Risk Assessment:**

The framework incorporates two primary aspects of risk:

1. **Hazardousness**: This refers to the inherent potential for a natural disaster to occur. It is assessed through a combination of factors:
    - **Elevation**: The elevation of a region can significantly influence its hazard profile. Higher elevations are often associated with risks such as landslides, avalanches, hypoxemia, and seismic activity. However, specific data on the elevation of Indian sub-districts is not readily available and would require detailed topographic surveys. I used Google Earth data for elevation monitoring of a region and used the website [mapcarta](https://mapcarta.com/), an open-source map.
    - **Climate**: Temperature extremes (high and low) pose health risks, while precipitation patterns influence flood and drought risks. To create a sub-district-specific risk profile, use historical climate data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) \[IMD\]. The data for the subdistrict is not readily available, so we use data from the district for analysis. If we project the data on the subdistrict level, we can use temperature averages from weather channels.
    - **Population Density**: Lower Population density suggests fewer resources and infrastructure to cope with a disaster. This can exacerbate the impact of an event. So, I use population density as a factor in the area's remoteness.
    - **LWE areas**: The scheme envisages the creation of Skill Development infrastructure closer to the people of left-wing extremism ([LWE](https://dgt.gov.in/Left_Wing_Extremism#:~:text=The%20scheme%20envisages%20creation%20of,LWE%20Districts%20in%2010%20States.)) affected districts. The scheme covers 48 LWE Districts in 10 States.
2. **Life Threat: This aspect considers threats to human life and security:**
    - **Border Proximity**: Bordering another country increases the risk of armed conflict and cross-border incursions: Utilise government sources or spatial data on administrative boundaries to identify border sub-districts.
    - **Terrorist and Maoist Activity**: Past incidents of terrorism or Maoist activity, obtained from the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP) \[SATP\], indicate a higher potential for future attacks.
    - **Elevation**: The elevation of a region higher than 8000 ft can also be a life threat index.

- **Data Sources:**
  - Elevation data can be freely acquired from digital elevation models (DEMs) offered by USGS EarthExplorer \[USGS EarthExplorer\] and mapcarta.
  - Population density data can be retrieved from the Census of India or GIS databases.
  - Temperature data is from the Google Temperature Historical database and the Weather Channel.
  - The source of LWE areas is <https://dgt.gov.in/Left_Wing_Extremism#:~:text=The%20scheme%20envisages%20creation%20of,LWE%20Districts%20in%2010%20States>
- **Scoring System**: Develop a scoring system for each factor based on its potential impact. Higher scores should reflect a more significant risk. Consider a weighted system where factors with a statistically proven higher correlation to disasters receive a higher weighting in the final score.
- **Spatial Analysis**: Utilise Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to create thematic maps depicting the spatial distribution of various risk scores across sub-districts. This allows for a clear visualisation of high-risk areas.

**Scoring System:**

**Developing a Scoring System for Risk Hardship using Linear Regression with Weights Applications and Benefits:**

Here is a breakdown of developing a scoring system for risk hardship based on linear regression with weights using the provided factors:

**Data Acquisition**: You will need data for all the factors mentioned:

1. elevation_modified
2. population_sq_km_modified
3. temp_modified
4. border_modified (likely a binary variable indicating a border region or not)
5. terrorism_modified (possibly attack frequency or intensity)
6. maoist_modified (similar to terrorism_modified for Maoist attacks)
7. left-wing extremism (LWE incidents or intensity)

**Model Building:**

**Define the Target Variable**: You will need a variable representing the "risk hardship" you are trying to predict. This could be a score based on surveys, economic indicators, or a combination of factors.

**Linear Regression Model**: Here is the core formula for the linear regression model:

- Risk = β₀ + β₁ \* elevation_modified + β₄ \* border_modified + β₅ \* terrorism_modified + β₆ \* maoist_modified + ε
- Hardship  = β₀ + β₁ \* elevation_modified + β₂ \* population_sq_km_modified + β₃ \* temp_modified + β₇ \* LWE + ε
- β₀ is the intercept term.
- β₁ to β₇ are the weights assigned to each factor, representing their relative importance in predicting risk hardship.
- ε is the error term, accounting for unexplained variance

**Weight Estimation**: The weights (β) will be estimated using the predetermined hyperparameters or the parameters obtained by the various algorithms for linear regression, and statistical software can handle these calculations.

**Feature Selection**:

1. **Elevation Modification**: A new column, elevation_modified, is created as a copy of the elevation column. If the elevation is less than 8000, it is multiplied by 0.5. This operation could reduce the influence of extreme elevation values in subsequent analysis. The elevation_modified column is then normalised by dividing each value by the maximum value in the column. Normalisation scales all values in the column to a range between 0 and 1, which can be helpful for certain types of statistical analysis.
2. **Population Density Modification**: A new column population_sq_km_modified is created by normalising the Population per sq. km. column. This is done by dividing each value in the column by the maximum value of the column.
3. **Temperature Modification**: A new column temp_modified is created by normalising the temp (mean) column. This is done by dividing each value in the column by the maximum value of the column.
4. **Border Modification**: A new column, border_modified, is created by normalising the border column. This is done by dividing each value in the column by the maximum value of the column.
5. **Terrorism Modification**: The code mentions the creation of a new column terrorism_modified as a copy of the terrorist attacks column and its normalisation. However, the actual code for this operation needs to be provided.

In summary, the methodology involves creating modified versions of specific columns in the DataFrame, with modifications including a specific operation for values below a certain threshold (in the case of elevation_modified) and normalisation of values (in all cases). These transformations are often performed in data preprocessing to prepare the data for machine learning or statistical analysis.

**Risk-Hardship Index Calculation**: A new column, risk_hardship_matrix_index, is created in the DataFrame df. This column is the product of the 'Risk' and 'Hardship' columns. This operation suggests that the 'Risk' and 'Hardship' values are being combined into a single index, which could be used to summarise or rank the entities represented in the DataFrame based on these two factors.

**Risk-Hardship Matrix Creation**: A matrix risk_hardship_matrix is created using the outer product of the 'Risk' and 'Hardship' columns. The outer product of two vectors creates a matrix where each element is the product of an element from the first vector and an element from the second vector. This matrix could be used to analyse the relationship between 'Risk' and 'Hardship' across all combinations of their values.

In summary, the methodology involves creating a new index in the DataFrame that combines 'Risk' and 'Hardship' values and creating a matrix that represents all combinations of 'Risk' and 'Hardship' values. These transformations could be used for further analysis or visualisation of the relationship between 'Risk' and 'Hardship'.

**For risk Hardship categorisation in the data:**

**Risk Value Categorisation**: A new column risk_value is created in the DataFrame df. This column is initially filled with zeros. Then, based on the value of the 'Risk' column, the risk_value is set to 1, 2, or 3. If 'Risk' is less than 0.333333, risk_value is set to 1. If 'Risk' is between 0.333333 (inclusive) and 0.666666, risk_value is set to 2. If 'Risk' is greater than or equal to 0.666666, risk_value is set to 3. This operation suggests that the 'Risk' values are being categorised into three distinct groups.

**Hardship Value Categorisation**: A similar operation is performed for the 'Hardship' column. A new column, hardship_value, is created and initially filled with zeros. Then, based on the value of the 'Hardship' column, the hardship_value is set to 1, 2, or 3 using the same thresholds as for risk_value. This operation suggests that the 'Hardship' values are also being categorised into three distinct groups.

- **Targeted Risk Mitigation**: The risk assessment can be used by policymakers to:
  - Prioritise resource allocation for disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts in high-risk sub-districts. This could involve investments in early warning systems, evacuation plans, and infrastructure improvements.
  - Develop targeted security strategies for border areas and regions prone to terrorist or Maoist activity.
- **Improved Decision-Making**: The framework provides valuable insights for:
  - Land-use planning to minimise risks associated with future development.
  - We are identifying vulnerable communities for targeted social welfare programs to enhance disaster resilience.

**Enhancing the Framework:**

- Vulnerability Assessment: Incorporate social vulnerability factors like poverty, access to healthcare, and education to create a more holistic understanding of risk. Sub-districts with lower socioeconomic indicators are likely to be more impacted by disasters.
- Infrastructure Assessment: Evaluate the quality of infrastructure like roads, bridges, and communication networks. Poor infrastructure can hinder response and recovery efforts in the aftermath of a disaster.
- Regular Updates: Regularly update the assessment with new data on hazards, threats, and infrastructure to ensure effectiveness.

**Conclusion:**

By implementing this comprehensive framework, Indian authorities can gain valuable insights to proactively mitigate risks and enhance the safety and security of their sub-districts. The framework allows for a data-driven approach to resource allocation and targeted interventions, ultimately promoting disaster preparedness and a more resilient India.
